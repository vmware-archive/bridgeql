# BridgeQL


`bridgeql` is part of VMware's support for open source development
and community.

A library which will add feature to serve your model over rest API
* This will allow users to make ORM query based on any models present in the django app
* This will ask user to provide request in defined format and will serve the API response as json data
* This will allow users to make filter, selection, ordering, slicing and count of model objects

As of today we only support for [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), will add support for [sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) soon.

## Django Integration

### Installation

You can install it directly from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/bridgeql/) using
```shell
pip install bridgeql
```

The bridgeql library can be integrated to the Django app by editing settings
file by including `bridgeql` in the `settings.INSTALLED_APPS` variable.
Another change required is to add a url to your existing project as

```
    projectname/projectname/settings.py
```

```python

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'bridgeql',
    ...
    ]

```

**URLs Configuration**

In your project you can edit `urls.py`, to include the `bridgeql` urls.

```python
from bridgeql.django import urls as bridgeql_urls
...

urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path('api/bridgeql/', include(bridgeql_urls)),
    ...
]
...
```
This way your app will be ready to serve the REST API to expose model query, you can request an API like follows:
```python
    params = {
       'db_name': 'db1',
       'app_name': 'machine', # required
       'model_name': 'Machine', # required
       'filter': {
           'os__name': 'os-name-1'
        },
        'fields': ['ip', 'name', 'id'],
        'exclude': {
           'name': 'machine-name-11'
        },
        'order_by': ['ip'],
        'limit': 5,
        'offset': 10, # default 0
    }
    api_url = '<yoursite.com>/api/bridgeql/dj_read'
    resp = make_get_api_call(api_url, {'payload': json.dumps(params)})
    result = resp.json()
```

The above parameters will translate into running the model query for `Machine` model of `machine` django app.

```python
Machine.objects.using('db1')
                .filter(os__name = 'os-name-1')
                .exclude(name = 'machine-name-11')
                .values(['ip', 'name', 'id'])
                .order_by('ip')[10:15] # offset: offset + limit
```

### BridgeQL Settings

Settings available in `BridgeQL` and their default values

**BRIDGEQL_ALLOWED_APPS**

Default: `[list of local apps]` (list)

By default, it will try to lookup your local apps for the project, considering `settings.BASE_DIR` or `settings.SITE_ROOT` (whichever is found) as your project root directory. If none of this will be available, `WARNING` will be there to setup `BRIDGEQL_ALLOWED_APPS` as application starts up.

Adding values as list of desired apps to `BRIDGEQL_ALLOWED_APPS` will allow you expose models only for the selected apps.
This way you can add django backend apps as well as third party apps e.g. `django.contrib.auth` which can expose `User` model.
You can combine next settings `BRIDGEQL_RESTRICTED_MODELS` to restrict few columns of that particular model e.g `password`.

```python
BRIDGEQL_ALLOWED_APPS = ['machine', 'django.contrib.auth']
```
______

**BRIDGEQL_RESTRICTED_MODELS**

Default: `{}` (Empty dictionary)

Dictionary mapping **app_label.model_name** strings to list/bool(True). The value represents list of fields to be restricted for the model as provided in key. If the value is set to `True`, all the fields of that model will be restricted to lookup.

```python
BRIDGEQL_RESTRICTED_MODELS = {
    'auth.User': True,
    'machine.OperatingSystem': ['license_key'],
}
```
______

**BRIDGEQL_AUTHENTICATION_DECORATOR**

Default: 
```
{
  'reader': '',
  'writer': ''
}
```

Above setting allows you to use an authentication decorator to authenticate your client's requests.
You can provide a custom authentication decorator, 
for reader and writer separately, whichever suits your application usecase, e.g login_required, same_subnet, etc.

Default value for `BRIDGEQL_AUTHENTICATION_DECORATOR` will allow you to access API without authentication.

```python
BRIDGEQL_AUTHENTICATION_DECORATOR = {
    'reader': 'bridgeql.auth.basic_auth',
    'writer': 'bridgeql.auth.basic_auth'
}
```

`bridgeql.auth.basic_auth` is available as a basic authentication method where you can pass authorization header as 
`Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)` for each request.
